Title: Exploring Street Greenery Distribution to Understand Socio-Economic Situation in Residential and Commercial Areas: A Machine Learning Approach Using Street View and Satellite Imagery.

Abstract:
The study aims to investigate the relationship between street greenery distribution and the socio-economic situation in residential and commercial areas using a machine learning approach. By analyzing street view and satellite imagery data, this research seeks to understand the impact of greenery on urban environments and its potential implications for the socio-economic characteristics of different neighborhoods. The proposed methodology involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and analysis. The results of this study could contribute to urban planning and policy-making efforts, promoting the creation of more equitable and sustainable cities.

1. Introduction:
   - Provide an overview of the importance of greenery in urban environments.
   - Discuss the potential relationship between street greenery and socio-economic factors.
   - State the research objectives and hypotheses.

2. Data Collection:
   - Identify the target study area(s) and obtain street view and satellite imagery datasets.
   - Ensure data availability and access permissions.
   - Collect socio-economic data for the selected study areas, such as income levels, education, crime rates, and property values.

3. Preprocessing:
   - Clean and preprocess the street view and satellite imagery data.
   - Handle missing or corrupted data.
   - Georeference the images to their corresponding locations.

4. Feature Extraction:
   - Define relevant features that capture street greenery, such as vegetation coverage, tree density, and green space availability.
   - Utilize computer vision techniques to extract features from street view images.
   - Extract vegetation indices and other relevant spatial features from satellite imagery.

5. Socio-Economic Data Integration:
   - Combine the extracted street greenery features with socio-economic data for each study area.

Title: "Analyzing the Correlation between Greenery and Socioeconomic Values Using Machine Learning"

Abstract:
This thesis aims to investigate the relationship between greenery and socioeconomic values using machine learning techniques. Greenery, including parks, gardens, and open spaces, has been recognized as an important component of urban environments, contributing to various aspects of human well-being. Socioeconomic values, such as income levels, education, and employment, are critical indicators of community prosperity and development. By employing machine learning algorithms, this study seeks to explore the potential correlations between the presence and accessibility of green spaces and socioeconomic factors in urban areas.

Research Objectives:
1. Evaluate the availability and distribution of green spaces in different urban regions.
2. Gather socioeconomic data related to income, education, employment, and other relevant indicators.
3. Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze the relationship between greenery and socioeconomic values.
4. Identify patterns and trends that emerge from the analysis to gain insights into the correlation.
5. Provide recommendations for urban planning and policy development based on the findings.

Methodology:
1. Data collection: Gather geospatial data on green spaces using satellite imagery, maps, and public databases. Collect socioeconomic data from relevant sources such as census data, surveys, and public records.
2. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, including spatial data integration and standardization of socioeconomic variables.
3. Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the data, such as the proximity of green spaces to residential areas, the size of green spaces, and socioeconomic indicators.
4. Machine learning analysis: Utilize regression or classification algorithms to model the correlation between greenery and socioeconomic values. Examples of suitable algorithms include linear regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.
5. Interpretation and visualization: Analyze the model outputs and visualize the results to identify patterns and relationships between greenery and socioeconomic factors.
6. Policy recommendations: Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings, aiming to guide urban planning and development initiatives.

Expected Results:
The thesis expects to uncover valuable insights regarding the correlation between greenery and socioeconomic values. Potential outcomes may include the identification of neighborhoods with low access to green spaces but high socioeconomic needs, the quantification of the impact of green spaces on socioeconomic indicators, and the formulation of evidence-based recommendations to enhance the presence and accessibility of greenery in urban areas.

By exploring this topic, the thesis aims to contribute to the growing field of urban planning and sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of incorporating green spaces into urban landscapes for improved socioeconomic outcomes.
