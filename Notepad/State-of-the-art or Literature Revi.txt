**paper 01 Title: 
Who lives in greener neighborhoods? The distribution of street greenery and its association with residents’ socioeconomic conditions in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.

About the Dataset: 
The dataset used in the thesis consists of Google Street View (GSV) images and census data
Seven social variables at the block group level were chosen from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) data.
Methodology:
Collection of Google Street View (GSV) Images.
Green View Index Calculation and Mapping.
Extraction of Social Variables from Census Data.
Result: 
the green view index values varied from 2.6 to 61.8, with a mean value of 24.4

Deep Green Diagnostics: Urban Green Space Analysis Using Deep Learning and Drone Images

Methodology:
a convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting features from the images and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) acting as a classifier.

dataset:
The data for the study was collected using a DJI Phantom 4 drone, which captured 9901 aerial images from parks, university campuses, suburban neighbourhoods, and forested areas.

Result:
The study results showed that the test accuracy, precision, and recall was 72%, while the F1-score was 71%.

**paper 05 Title:
Development of a system for assessing the quality of urban street-level greenery using street view images and deep learning

Methodology:
Panoramic View Green View Index (PVGVI), Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using DeepLabV3+.

dataset:
The research utilized the Cityscapes dataset, comprising recorded street videos from 50 cities, to evaluate their proposed method. For the study area in Suita, Osaka, Japan, a total of 24,920 Google Street View images (1000 × 1000 pixels) were utilized.

Result:
The research results showed that the proposed method achieved an mIoU of 78.37%, an RMSE of 2.75%, and an MAE of 2.28%
