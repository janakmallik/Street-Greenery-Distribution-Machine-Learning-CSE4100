**goal**  
analyze and understand the distribution of greenery within a residential area  
and then investigate potential correlations between this greenery distribution and socio-economic factors  

**aim**  
uncover relationships between the presence of green spaces and the socio-economic characteristics of different residential neighborhoods.  

# Thesis Procedure
## A. Greenery Distribution Detection

    need answers for:
    - what parameters we should use for Greenery Distribution Detection, so that we can compare the distribution with socio-economic factors in genetic algorithm..?
    - and how we can get these values of distribution..

### 1. Data Collection
    - Collecting Satellite imagery of the residential area - Google Earth  
    - residential area - Gulshan, Dhanmondi, Bashundhara  
    - Segment and Divide satellite images into distinct segments  
    - (different neighborhoods or zones within the residential area)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
    - Image Resizing  
    - Image Normalization  
    - Correcting Image Distortions  
    - Image Distortions: sensor noise, and atmospheric effects  
    - Labeling by area  

### 3. Vegetation Index Calculation
    Calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Canopy Cover for each segment  

    - NDVI Visualization
        - visualizations of NDVI values
        - NDVI maps / heatmaps / color-coded representations
    - Canopy Cover measurement
        - 

### 4. Spatial Mapping (Spatial Context)
    Overlay the green areas onto a map of the residential area  
    providing a visual representation of greenery distribution.
