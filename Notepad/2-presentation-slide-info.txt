#Introduction
1.Urban green spaces provide multiple benefits, but absence or unequal access in their distribution raise concerns.

2.This research investigates the correlation between the socio-economic situation and street greenery distribution.

3.Street greenery contributes to neighborhood attractiveness, walkability, creating a peaceful environment and resident well-being.

4.Greenery helps reduce the urban heat island effect, reduce power consumption contributing to a more sustainable urban environment.

5.The goal is to promote greenery and it's equitable access to urban green spaces.

#Motivation
1.The motivation behind this thesis stems from the importance of urban green spaces in enhancing the quality of life and well-being of urban residents.

2.How greenery is distributed in residential areas, and is it sufficient enough for a stable socio-economic conditions.

3.Comparing the distribution of greenery with parameters such as property values, thermal comfort, energy consumption, and respiratory diseases.

4.Informing urban planning and policy-making for quality access to green spaces and addressing environmental disparities.

#State-of-the-art or Literature Review

#Research Gap
1.Limited understanding of street greenery distribution in relation to socioeconomic factors.
2.Insufficient Integration of Machine Learning, advanced machine learning approach needed.

#Proposed Methodology
