- which includes interstatehighways, state highways, and streets, from the TIGER datasets.
- A Python script was developed to read the longitude and latitudeof each selected sample site and download the Google Street ViewImages.
- Therefore, the object-based classification method is more suitablefor green vegetation extraction from GSV images compared withpixel-based methods.
- After segmentation, new the-matic images were generated by setting the attribute of each objectto the average value of pixels within that object in each of the threeRGB bands.
- thematic images were used to extract green vegetation
- repre-sent the racial/ethnic and socio-economic status used in this study.The seven selected social variables include per capita income, pro-portion of African Americans, proportion of non-Hispanic Whites,proportion of Hispanics, proportion of owner-occupied units, pro-portion of people with a bachelor or higher degree, and proportionof people without a high school degree.
- Economic status is an indicator of people’s interaction withtheir physical environments, because it affects their capabil-ity to improve their physical environments.
- 

Statistical analyses wereconducted in three stages. 
- First, bivariate correlation was used toexplore the associations between the green view index and eachof the social variables at the block group level.
- Second, an ordinary least square (OLS) multivariate regression was conducted to modelthe relationships between dependent (the green view index) andindependent variables (social variables). Only those independentvariables indicating statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlationswith the green view index were selected for regression analysis.
	- The final listof the independent variables in the regression model includes percapita income, proportion of owner-occupied units, and proportionof Hispanics.
- Finally, the spatial autocorrelation of regression residualswas analyzed using the global Moran’s I-statistics to determinewhether the regression results were spatially biased (Landry andChakraborty, 2009).
	- the spatial weight matrixwas calculated based on the Euclidean distances between cen-troids of block groups.
