You ever notice how it's often the same people complaining about burnouts that are watching and seeking productivity advice? If you have a friend who's complaining about a headache from banging his head against the wall, what do you tell them? Dude, stop banging your head! Have you considered time blocking your day in 90-minute chunks? Watch everything in 2x, 3x, 4x speed. If you push past it, eventually you're going to burn out and your productivity is going to drop to zero for days, months, even years. The people I see obsessed with productivity advice don't actually need it. They need focusing advice, and that's very different. Focusing advice is doing less but better. And I have found that when you slow down instead of speeding up with productivity, your work actually becomes easier and better. So next time you're looking at your to-do list with 30 things stacked on it, instead of asking yourself how can I do them all more for the sake of more, a way better question you can ask is, what are the two to three things that actually matter here? Because if you don't, it's human nature to check all the easy things, and what you're left with are the two to three big ones.
